<p>As IPv6 deployment becomes more pervasive, it makes sense that v6-only users and v6-only sites will become more common.  bin6 is a project aimed at putting one of the more common utilities out there, v6-only.  Due to the large number of pastebins available, it makes sense to take a common utility and make it v6-only, since the provider isn't out much if it doesn't get used, and there are plenty of other bins out there for someone who doesn't have v6 access.</p>

<p>Who can use it?  We're well aware that not many people have a case where they can pastebin something and know their audience can reach it if it is on v6, but for those who are in that situation, here you go.  These entries do not have an expiration date.  We look forward to serving you and seeing what comes with running a v6-only site.  Got any suggestions?  Please use the Contact Us link down below to give us your ideas for how to improve our service.</p>

<p>bin6 was created out of interest to see if a v6-only site can get any market share or even moderate use without search engine indexing (currently) and with a very specific audience that can currently use it effectively.  Pastes expire after they are not viewed for 1 year, but will not expire if they are viewed at least once every 365.25 days.  bin6 will continue to be free (who would charge for a pastebin?), though may have ads at some point only if they are served purely over v6 or dual-stack (and even then probably more for the experimental value than the monetary value).
